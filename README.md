This is where my development progress will be shared for using machine learning and LIDAR to detect other FRC robots are during a match. This is one stepping stone to one day having a
fully AI strategised and driven match. It all starts with one thing: Robot localization of not just your own robot (that's easy) but everyone around you in high speed matches.
